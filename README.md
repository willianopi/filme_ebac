# Guerra nas Estrelas Landing Page 

The project is a dynamic web application that provides an interactive user experience. It features a responsive design with a variety of text styles, a button component with multiple variants, and a flexible image-text section. The design is built with SCSS, using variables for consistent theming and mixins for reusable styles. The project uses Gulp to automate various tasks, including compiling SCSS to CSS, minifying JavaScript, and optimizing images.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Vercel and can be accessed at [https://streaming-guerra-nas-estrelas.vercel.app/](https://guerra-nas-estrelas.vercel.app/).

## Running the Page Locally

To run the page locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    Cloning a repository means creating a local copy of the code provided on the remote server. To do this, you'll need Git installed on your computer. If you haven't installed Git, you can download it from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).

    Once you have Git installed, open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Then, run the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/maxh33/guerra-nas-estrelas
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

    This project relies on several development dependencies for tasks like compiling SCSS to CSS, minifying JavaScript, and optimizing images. These dependencies are listed in the `package.json` file in the project's root directory.

    The dependencies include:

    - `gulp`: A toolkit to automate & enhance your workflow
    - `gulp-sass`: A Gulp plugin for Sass compilation
    - `gulp-imagemin`: A Gulp plugin for image optimization
    - `gulp-uglify`: A Gulp plugin to minify JavaScript files

    To install these dependencies, you'll need to use Node Package Manager (npm), which is included with Node.js. If you haven't installed Node.js, you can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

    Once you have Node.js and npm installed, open a terminal in your project's root directory and run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev dependency-name
    ```

4. Build the project:

    This project uses Gulp to run tasks such as compiling SCSS to CSS, minifying JavaScript, and optimizing images. The necessary Gulp tasks have been defined in a `gulpfile.js` file in the project's root directory.

    To build the project, run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    To start the development server and watch for changes, run the following command:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```


5. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

    Alternatively, if you're using Visual Studio Code as your IDE, you can use the Live Server extension to serve your project. 

    To do this, first install the Live Server extension from the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X). Then, right-click on your HTML file in the Explorer view and select "Open with Live Server" from the context menu. This will start a local development server and open your default web browser to display your project.
